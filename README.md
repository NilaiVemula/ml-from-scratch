# ml-from-scratch

The goal of this project is to write machine learning algorithms from scratch in Python. I have been using and learning about different types of machine learning algorithms in the past, but I don't really know how all of them work. In order to gain a better understanding of these algorithms and the math behind them, I will attempt to write as many of them by hand as possible using nothing more than the built in data structures of Python, `numpy` for matrix algebra, and `matplotlib` to visualize the results.

# Sources

I borrow from some sources to learn the mathematics behind these algorithms.
