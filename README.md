**Author**: Nilai Vemula

**Description**: The goal of this project is to write machine learning algorithms from scratch in Python. I have been using and learning about different types of machine learning algorithms in the past, but I don't really know how all of them work. In order to gain a better understanding of these algorithms and the math behind them, I will attempt to write as many of them by hand as possible using nothing more than the built in data structures of Python, `numpy` for matrix algebra, and `matplotlib` to visualize the results.

# Sources

I borrow from some sources to learn the mathematics behind these algorithms including [*An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R*](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/). Sources for specific algorithms are found in the respective folder.
